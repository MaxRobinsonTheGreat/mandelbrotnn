# Mandelbrot Neural Network

This is a very simple project that allows you to train neural networks on the mandelbrot set, 
generate images from the trained network at high resolution, and save videos of neural networks
learning the set as they train. 

Take a look at the main.py file for some example functions on how to use the modules.
